Alight so getting started here: we have a laptop with a fresh install of NixOS

We want to get it set up with all of our standard ish - what's first?

If our repo is public, we can just clone that to get started

I don't have SSH keys set up yet - so I had to use the HTTPS method

this might work with rpivate repos too?

wulfenite might serve as a good enough template to copy stuff over - the critical thing is that if anything is autogenerated, we need to keep it because I've gone through and encrypted this drive

nix-template

eval "$(direnv hook bash)"

ah, we cannot iuse `hostnamectl` to set the hostname temporarily, hm
